Can multiple plans share a common 3rd-party directory	"For example, you might have three repository directories, say, A, B, and C, where A is a common 3rd-party library. A is used across projects.

At this stage, Bamboo doesn't support having multiple checkout directories per build plan. However, you can work around this by setting these three directories up as separate Bamboo build plans - P A, P B and P C.

To make this work, you will also need to specify as an argument to your build scripts for P B and P C the location of A, which will be something like this:
../Plan_key_for_A/

Using a set up like this, your library module (A) should only be checked out once across the Bamboo instance."
Changing Bamboo database settings	The Bamboo database configuration is persisted in the <Bamboo-Home>/bamboo.cfg.xml file. You can change the database settings by editing this file
What exactly do you know about release planning in Bamboo?	It is basically a common approach in Bamboo. It must be done at least once a week. There are certain features that make it simply the best approach. Rough estimations are generally done when it comes to the starting backlog. Everything is calculated in points and everything in the release planning in Bamboo is best on same. 
Tell anything you know about the success factors of Atlassian Bamboo	It is basically an easy task to implement the tools but making the best use of this approach can be a very daunting time depending on a few factors. Something that matter the most is how frequently is you commit the code. It must be done at least once a week. 
How will you treat a failure in Atlassian Bamboo?	Basically, the chances for this are very less. However, in case it happens, the very first thing to consider is nothing by running the default error detector in the Atlassian Bamboo. It is an accurate approach and most of the time it simply indicates what is wrong in it. Next thing to pay attention to if there is a specific node that is creating the blockage at the network and annoying the traffic. 
Mention some steps that you know about the Atlassian Bamboo.	The very first thing is the compilation which is often followed by the unit test. Actually, a Unit test is important as many times it affects the network performance without giving any indication. Even if the traffic is high, this approach must be considered on priority. Next step is Code Quality Gates that simply let the users send their data from different channels. Integration tests and the chain tests are the other prime factors that must be paid attention to. 
Is it possible to cut down the time taken by Atlassian Bamboo build and get immediate feedback? If so? Tell how?	Well, one of the best things to consider here is splitting the long-running tests in a built that are generally separate. Immediate feedback can be assured without worrying about anything.
What is the significance of Atlassian Bamboo?	It is good in finding and dealing the complex issues that often declare their presence. The fact is defects are corrected at a very fast speed immediately when they are located. In addition to this, Bamboo is a powerful approach that cut down a lot of time to market. As the applications are always tested, they can simply be moved to next level without any issues. 
What do you know about the implementation of Atlassian Bamboo	Doing this is not a big deal. Diverse apparatuses for supporting this approach are Jenkins and Hudson Jenkins is the most famous one presently considered by a lot of users all over the world. They furnish combination with different form control frameworks and construct devices. There are factors that need to be taken care of especially in the initial stage. 
Have you ever gone against the rules of a confidential agreement? 	2No, I haven’t been a part of such an issue. I understand how confidentiality matters for any business. I can understand that to tackle factors such as competition there is a strong need for this and thus I haven’t been a part of any such incident. 
What are the benefits of using Bamboo approach?	There are certain benefits depending upon the task one is performing. The very first one is getting regular updates on failed and successful builds that are quite common in an organization. It is also helpful when it comes to automating and testing the applications code statues. If something one is handling needs a lot of statistical analysis, one of the best things is it has reporting tools for this purpose. Also, it can deal with different types of artifacts.
Name the two directories which are present in the Atlassian Bamboo	They are home directory and installation directory.
Mention the features with which the Atlassian Bamboo is equipped with	Build failures are caught automatically and thus helps in saving time, wastage of efforts as well as money. For a code commit modifies, there is an automatic notification that is acknowledged about the reports. It is possible to integrate it with LDAP mail-server. It is also possible to automate various processes that are associated with the project.
How a backup is created in the Bamboo and how the files are copied to it?	Doing this is easy and important too. By default, Bamboo makes use of home directory for saving all the data including the settings, user information and so on. You need to simply copy this directory for creating a backup. A clone of same can simply be created and its location can be kept anywhere. Data can be set to be copied in the clone directory after a specific time period or continuously. 
Name some SCM tools which are supported by Atlassian Bamboo	These are subversion, Git, RTC, Clearcase, Subversion, CVS, Accurev, and Mercurial. There are other SCM tools but they are user-friendly and are easy to use.
What are the basic requirements for using Atlassian Bamboo	The source code repository is one of the prime needs. Without it, there are certain challenges that can be there and affect the efficiency of work up to a great extent.
What will happen if any changes got missed in the Bamboo?	Broken build is often observed when this happens. For this, one can simply check the console output. From there, you can see the changes if not accepted or approved can be seen easily. The local workplace can be updated to avoid the issue and this can solve the problem.
Name any two testing tools that Bamboo is compatible with?	Junit and PHPUnit. 
What are the tools supported by Bamboo?	Bamboo supports some of the very important tools as it has build tasks for Make, ant, MSBuild, as well as Maven. This is also the reason that why a user can simply perform the task in different languages without worrying about anything.
What are the benefits of running automated tests in Bamboo?	It will make finding and correctcting the errors fast and help users saving their valuable time.
Does Bamboo available as a cloud service too?	Yes, it is available.
How do I shut down my elastic instances if I have restarted my Bamboo server	If you restart your Bamboo server without shutting down your elastic instances first, your elastic instances will continue to run. Your elastic instances will also be orphaned from your Bamboo server, and you will not be able to shut them down via Bamboo after your Bamboo server has restarted. You will need to terminate them via the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Console.
