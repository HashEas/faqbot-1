Veracode	What languages and platforms does your static scanner support?	Veracode allows you to scan Java, JSP, .NET- C#, .NET - VB.NET, ASP.NET, .NET - C+/CLI, C/C+, PHP, ColdFusion, iOS, Android, J2ME, Ruby, Classic ASP, VBScript, VB6, Flash (using Dynamic), COBOL, and JavaScript for mobile and web applications! Our list of supported platforms and languages is always growing
Veracode	What email notifications will I get from Veracode?	Veracode keeps customers up to date with scan and overall service status via email. Veracode users will receive emails when: Password is changed, Pre-scan verification is complete, Scan is submitted, and Scan has completed.
Veracode	What is pre-scan verification?	The Veracode platform performs a preliminary analysis, or Pre-Scan, of your binaries to validate that they can be analyzed and to give you an opportunity to fix problems with the uploaded files before submitting your scan request. The results of the Pre-Scan verification are given as messages in the module table; summary information appears as you select modules to be scanned.
Veracode	I received an email saying there was an issue scanning my application. What should I do?	Veracode will send a scan failure email if issues are encountered scanning your application. Our engineering team will work with you to resolve any issues like this and ensure scan success.
Veracode	What is the difference between a Flaw and a Vulnerability?	Veracode scan highlights flaws discovered in a submitted binary. It is important to understand that not all flaws will be exploitable vulnerabilities. A flaw is a potential vulnerability. A flaw is a pattern that is flagged in the analyzed binary that is indicative of a vulnerability. A vulnerability is a hole within the security of a system caused by software flaws, incorrect configurations and/or insecure user behavior.
Veracode	What flaw categories do you look for?	Input Validation, Memory Corruption, Numeric Errors, Cryptographic Issues
Veracode	Why do I upload my binaries to Veracode? Do you also need my source code?	Veracodes automated static binary analysis reviews the final integrated application without requiring organizations to expose their intellectual property in the form of source code.
Veracode	Why should I use Veracode instead of a desktop source code analyzer?	Veracode is out to change the world of software by solving this application security challenge in a fundamentally different and better way. Our cloud-based application risk management services platform offers the industrys most complete, accurate and easy to use application security testing,developer trainingandapplication intelligenceservices.
Veracode	Why do I need to package my java app as a war file?	Veracode expects Java web applications to be submitted in a standard WAR format. This is so that, regardless of the application server technology being used, Veracode can correctly analyze the data and control flow of the application and understand the application boundaries. Veracode understands standard J2EE application packages, including JAR, WAR, and EAR.
Veracode	How long will it take to get my results?	Veracode performs a fully automated scan on uploaded applications, including constructing a model of the data and control flow and identifying any flaws. The turnaround time depends on the size and complexity of the application, but on average Veracode analyzes 75% of all uploaded Java applications in six hours or less.
Veracode	I only see the source file and line number where the issue exists. How can I tell where the attack is coming from?	Each cross-site scripting flaw in the Veracode service carries two types of information: the location at which the flaw is exposed to the end user, and the data or control flow through which a tainted attack string travels to reach the vulnerable part of the code. You can view this control flow in the Call Stack view
Veracode	I like the Veracode web interface, but I do all my work in my IDE. Can you show me the results there? I also would like to upload my application directly as part of my build script rather than visiting the Veracode UI.	Veracode provides APIs for uploading applications and viewing results, and includes reference integrations to several bugtracking systems and integrated development environments, including Eclipse and Visual Studio.
Veracode	Does theVeracode Eclipse Pluginwork with other Eclipse-derived IDEs?	TheVeracode Eclipse Pluginmay run on Eclipse-derived IDEs like Spring Suite, but Veracode does not provide support for these IDEs.
Veracode	How do I check prescan results in the API?	Prescans usually complete very quickly and you receive email notifications when they complete. If you want to check for prescan results using the Upload API, use thegetprescanresults.docall.
Veracode	"How do I run an API scan if there are ""unsupported frameworks"" warnings in my prescan results?"	If you want to ensure the scan completes even though there are non-fatal errors such as unsupported frameworks, ensure you use thescan_all_top_level_modulesparameter when you use thebeginscan.docall. Alternately, you can usescan_selected_modules,scan_previously_selected_modules, or modules with a list of module IDs, returned by the prescan.
Veracode	How do I use the API to query tags in the Results API?	If you want to query tags in applications, you can add unique tags as metadata when creating your applications. You can then query your applications based on any of the metadata. Usecreateapp.doto create an application with metadata. Use the following calls of theResults APIto get the scan results of applications:getapplist.doto get the full list of your applicationsand thengetappinfo.doto get information for a specific application, including any metadata, if applicable. To get a detailed report for any application, calldetailedreport.do, which returns the results in an XML document.
Veracode	Why does Veracode use passwords for API integrations? I thought passwords were inherently insecure.	Veracode recommends that you change to using theVeracode API ID and keywithHMAC signing, where possible, because this method provides maximum protection againstman-in-the-middleand session replay attacks. User credential authentication using username and password is only supported on the Veracode XML APIs, which are the legacy APIs, while the REST APIs are the newer APIs that Veracode offers.
Octane	Why does my run history show updated records when I did not update any records, but only created records?	"New field values created in a destination endpoint during synchronization are automatically sent back the record in the source endpoint.
Octane	So, for example, when you create a record in ALM and synchronize it to ALM Octane, that new record is created in ALM Octane, and assigned an ALM Octane ID.
ALM Octane Synchronizer recognizes this new ID field value, and sends it back to ALM, adding it to the source record.

This last step is the update you see in your run history."
Octane	I modified my link to fix errors that occurred in previous synchronizations. Why do I see these same errors occurring again?	"If your link is in automatic mode, and a synchronization ran with errors, the records with errors are not necessarily fixed in subsequent runs.

This may happen if the errors occurred because of changes outside of the link configuration, such as if the schema changed, but the field mapping was not updated. If you fix the cause of the error (such as refreshing the Field Mapping tab and map the new fields), ALM Octane Synchronizer will re-synchronize those records if changes in the actual record are detected.

ALM Octane Synchronizer also periodically re-synchronizes all records, including those that had run with errors, but have had no subsequent changes.

To ensure that records that ran with errors are re-synchronized in the next upcoming run, manually set the link to re-synchronize those records.

For details, see Re-synchronizing records with fixed errors (automatic mode only)."
Octane	Why is the Search Links box in the link tree disabled?	You cannot search in the link tree when a link is in edit mode. Save any changes or click Cancel Edit to enable the search box.
Octane	"Why can't I access Synchronizer? I keep getting to a login page.
"	In certain cases you may try to open Synchronizer and a login page appears but you cannot log in. In this case you need to modify your authentication cookies setting, as described in Install the Synchronizer.
Octane	Why can't I edit mapped requirement types in my synchronization link?	After a link is synchronized, you can no longer remove mapped requirement types. You can still add types that are not yet mapped.
Octane	"Synchronization failed due to unmapped users. What should I do?
"	"When synchronization fails because of unmapped users, check if the missing users exist. If they do not, you can create them in ALM Octane (either as active users, or inactive). When you run synchronization again, the ALM users that were missing will be mapped to the newly-created users in ALM Octane. For details on adding or activating users in ALM Octane, see Assign roles and permissions and Assign roles and permissions.
"
Octane	During synchronization I received an error: “Some of the mapped fields were deleted from ALM Octane."	"This error indicates that user defined fields were removed from ALM Octane, which were mapped in a synchronization link. The list of missing fields is displayed in the UI.

Edit the relevant link within the Synchronizer UI, and click Refresh fields and field values in the Field mapping tab. All the removed fields will be removed from field mapping. Run an integrity check to verify that records will be synchronized correctly."
Octane	During synchronization I received an error: “Some of the fields used in the filter were deleted from ALM Octane."	"This error indicates that you removed user defined fields from ALM Octane, which were used in a Synchronizer filter within a particular synchronization link.

Either edit the existing filter, or create a new filter without the user defined fields that no longer exist. If you create a new filter, within the Synchronizer UI edit the appropriate link and change the Synchronizer filter in the General tab. Run an integrity check to verify that records will be synchronized correctly."
Octane	Why is ALM Octane Synchronizer failing to find a custom field that was OK in the past?	"Check the list of custom fields defined in ALM Octane:

In Settings , clickand select a shared space or a workspace.
In Entities, click User-defined Fields and select the entity whose fields you want to check.
Make sure that the field in question still defined for the workspace you are synchronizing."
Octane	Why is the synchronization adding attachments named attachment.url to the ALM Octane entities?	"This may happen if an ALM entity has an attachment whose name contains special characters (~!@#$%()^&).

Workaround: On ALM Octane, remove the added attachment. On ALM, rename the attachment so that it does not contain special characters."
Fortify	Why am I not receiving emails after configuring Issue notifications?	If you configured Issue notifications but you are not receiving emails as expected, define values for FROM_EMAIL_ADDRESS & MAIL_SERVER_HOST in the sync_sa schema.

Fortify	How can I crawl application using proxy to IE or Firefox with step mode.	login macro with a manual/step mode scan as authentication should be captured during the recording of the manual scan.
Fortify	My application does not allow concurrent logins. When I run a scan with WI I get error messages which i suspect is due to concurrent login attempts. Is there any way by which I enable WI to manage concurrent sessions in my application?	A solution to this problem is to convert the recorded credentials in a login macro to parameters and use multiple login accounts with the same application privileges. You can use the Multi-user Login option in the Scan Settings: Authentication window to parameterize the username and password in a login macro, and define multiple username and password pairs to use in a scan. This approach allows the scan to run across multiple threads. Each thread has a different login session, resulting in faster scan times.
